5 Behaviorial Questions

1. Talk about a time when you had to work closely with someone whose personality was very different from yours.

Situation: I worked in a group for my Capstone project where one of my partners did not always listen to my suggestions for the code and got upset easily.
Task: I recommended a code fix and they basically ignored my response and kept trying to fix the solution.
Action: I would watch them code for a minute or two and then try to rephrase my suggested fix in a better way that they would understand so they would want to try it.
Resolution: When their fix did not work they would ask if anybody had a fix and I would politely say my response again and they would be more open to try it now.

***************************
2. Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?

Situation: I work in a helpdesk taking calls from customers
Task: Customers will sometimes not listen to my questions and not respond to them and keep rambling on about their issue when I already have an idea of how to fix it.
Action: I let the customer keep talking, and I usually politely ask my question multiple times.
Resolution: After they hear me ask the same question, they usually realize we are going in circles and actually listen to the question and respond.

************************
3. Describe a time when you had to interact with a difficult client. What was the situation, and how did you handle it?

Situation: I take calls from customers and can't always give them good news
Task: Sometimes the resolution I have to give customers is not an easy one, and they are not pleased
Action: I let them know that while it is not convienent, it is the best way to get their computer fixed and on their way
Resolution: They accept their answer and are on their way

************************
4. Sometimes it’s just not possible to get everything on your to-do list done. Tell me about a time your responsibilities got a little overwhelming. What did you do?

Situation: I had multiple tasks assigned to me at work with a deadline of EOD
Task: A few tasks were unable to be completed today due to things outside of my control
Action: I let my supervisor know about the tasks that can't be completed and why. I then ranked the tasks on how I think they should be done and verify with my supervisor this is the way.
Resolution: Get as many done as I can and report back to my supervisor EOD

************************
5. Give me an example of a time when you had to explain something fairly complex to a frustrated client. How did you handle this delicate situation?

Situation: I had to explain the new certificate alignment process to a customer
Task: The customer did not understand why he needed to be on base and why at a machine on an ethernet cable and how the alignment helped anything
Action: Luckily I have had experience explaining this process before, so I drill down a bit more into the process, letting the customer know exactly what happens when we make a change to their active directory account. I also let them know they aren't the only ones with this issue.
Resolution: The customer usually feels better knowing they know why this is the solution and they are not alone in this problem.

Whiteboard Challenges (partner: Jason)

-Create a function that takes length and width and finds the perimeter of a rectangle.

	This one was pretty easy and I was able to solve it quickly. Jason challenged me to fit the solution into 1 line which I did. He then showed me an even better 1 line solution after this.

-Give me a string starting with "something", then a space, followed by the given argument a.

	This was also fairly easy. Jason and I talked about the different ways that we would have solved this one.

-Create a function that returns the thickness (in meters) of a piece of paper after folding it n number of times. The paper starts off with a thickness of 0.5mm.

	This one was very tough and I did not figure it out on my own. Jason took a stab at it as he did not know the solution. Together we solved it and talked about why that was the solution.
